## Enable Share-to-Teams

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you have [Microsoft Teams JavaScript Client SDK v2 Preview](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-beta&preserve-view=true&branch=pr-en-us-5129) (`@microsoft/teams-js@1.11.0-beta.7`) to enable Share-to-Teams.

To enable Share-to-Teams in your personal tab or app,
call `microsoftTeams.sharing.shareWebContent` with a payload.

The following example explains how to create a payload:

```json
microsoftTeams.sharing.shareWebContent({
        content: [
          {
            type: 'URL',
            url: '<URL to be shared>',
            preview: true
          }
        ]
      });
```

The payload contains the following parameters:

| Property name | Purpose |
